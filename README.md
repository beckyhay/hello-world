Hi all, my name is Becca and I was born and raised here in Tucson. My main hobby is music - I play piano, percussion, flute and piccolo. 
I currently play all these in a community group called Storm Watch. I am also Native American, belonging to the Pascua Yaqui Tribe and Cherokee nation. In the future, I hope to create a music program on the Yaqui reservation.
I am very excited to continue learning about GIS, especially Q. I learned this in my first GIS class back in 2019, however have now learned how to use ESRI products more than Q.
